# Contributing

* Repository uses fast-forward merges
* Each commit title starts with jira task number e.g. RCV-123321: Introduce new bugs

  (this implicitly allows you to violate 50 symbols limit for commit title)

* Commit titles are imperative
* Single commit represents atomic change in code 
* Squashing commits is encouraged

**Reminder**

Don't forget to write an unit test for new functionality introduced!
